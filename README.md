# This is a sample project to demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline using Nx
### This uses github actions to deploy the app to AWS ECS
Pre-requisites:
- AWS account and User (Access key and Secret key)
- AWS ECR repository created
- AWS ECS cluster created
- AWS ECS task definition created
- AWS ECS service created

Once you have setup the above, you can follow the steps below to setup the CI/CD pipeline
Change the following in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file according to your setup
- AWS_REGION
- ECR_REPOSITORY
- ECS_SERVICE
- ECS_CLUSTER
- ECS_TASK_DEFINITION
- CONTAINER_NAME

Also go to repository settings and add the following secrets in action secrets.
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

Once this is done, you can push the code to the main branch and the pipeline will be triggered.
